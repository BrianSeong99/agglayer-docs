## Meet the Bridge Service API: Your Gateway to Cross-Chain Data

Building a bridge application shouldn't require running an entire AggKit infrastructure. The **Bridge Service API** is your **direct gateway** to all the bridge data you need - transaction histories, claim statuses, cryptographic proofs, and network information - available through simple REST endpoints.

**Think of it as**: Your personal bridge data assistant that has already indexed everything, organized it perfectly, and can answer any question about cross-chain activity instantly.

### **The Challenge Bridge Developers Face**

Imagine you're building a bridge interface for users. Without the Bridge Service API, you'd need to:

- Run and maintain multiple blockchain indexers
- Implement complex Merkle proof generation
- Handle multi-network synchronization
- Build sophisticated filtering and pagination systems

**With Bridge Service API**: You make a simple HTTP request and get exactly the data you need, instantly formatted and ready to use in your application.

## What Bridge Developers Actually Need

### **"Has my user's bridge transaction been processed?"**
Get instant answers about any bridge transaction status across all networks, with rich filtering by address, network, or transaction details.

### **"Can my user claim their bridged assets yet?"**
Check claim readiness, generate the required proofs, and verify completion status - all the data needed for a seamless claiming experience.

### **"How do I build a bridge transaction monitor?"**
Access comprehensive transaction histories, real-time status updates, and automated proof generation to create powerful user interfaces.

### **"What bridges are happening across the ecosystem?"**
Monitor bridge activity, track network health, and analyze cross-chain flows for analytics and business intelligence.

## Getting Started: Your First API Call

The Bridge Service API uses **simple REST endpoints** with no authentication required for most operations:

```bash
# Check if the API is running
curl "http://localhost:5577/bridge/v1/"

# Get recent bridge transactions on a network
curl "http://localhost:5577/bridge/v1/bridges?network_id=0&page_size=5"
```

**API Structure**: All endpoints follow the pattern `{base_url}/bridge/v1/{endpoint}` with consistent JSON responses and intuitive parameter names.

## Real-World Example: Building a Bridge Monitor

Let's walk through building a practical bridge monitoring interface:

### **Step 1: Show User's Bridge History**

```bash
# Get all bridges for a specific user address
curl "http://localhost:5577/bridge/v1/bridges?network_id=0&from_address=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
```

**Response**: Complete transaction history with amounts, timestamps, and claim status.

### **Step 2: Check What's Ready to Claim**

```bash
# Filter for claimable transactions
curl "http://localhost:5577/bridge/v1/bridges?network_id=0&from_address=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266&ready_for_claim=true"
```

**Response**: Only transactions that are ready for users to claim.

### **Step 3: Generate Claim Proof**

```bash
# Get the proof needed for claiming
curl "http://localhost:5577/bridge/v1/claim-proof?network_id=0&deposit_count=42&leaf_index=15"
```

**Response**: Complete cryptographic proof data that can be used directly in claim transactions.

**The result**: A fully functional bridge interface with just three API calls!
