    Advanced cross-chain functionality that enables direct contract calls on destination chains with asset transfers
  </p>
</div>

## Overview

Bridge-and-Call is an advanced feature of the Unified Bridge that allows developers to initiate cross-chain transactions that both transfer assets and execute smart contract functions on the destination chain in a single operation. This enables more complex cross-chain workflows and reduces the number of transactions required for sophisticated cross-chain applications.

## Key Differences from Bridge Message

| Feature | Bridge Message | Bridge-and-Call |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Destination Contract** | Must implement `IBridgeMessageReceiver` | Can call any contract |
| **Execution** | Contract handles message reception | JumpPoint contract executes calls |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to specific interface | Full contract call flexibility |
| **Use Case** | Simple message passing | Complex cross-chain operations |

## Core Components

### BridgeExtension.sol

The main contract that handles Bridge-and-Call operations on both source and destination chains.

**Key Functions**:
- `bridgeAndCall()`: Initiates asset transfer with contract call
- `onMessageReceived()`: Handles incoming Bridge-and-Call messages

**Deployment**: Deployed on both L1 and all connected L2s

### JumpPoint.sol

A temporary contract that executes the actual function calls on the destination chain.

**Key Features**:
- **Temporary Contract**: Created for each Bridge-and-Call operation
- **Asset Handling**: Receives and manages transferred assets
- **Function Execution**: Executes calls on target contracts
- **Fallback Handling**: Manages failed executions

## Bridge-and-Call Function

The `bridgeAndCall` function initiates both asset transfer and contract execution.

### Function Signature

```solidity
function bridgeAndCall(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint32 destinationNetwork,
    address callAddress,
    address fallbackAddress,
    bytes calldata callData,
    bool forceUpdateGlobalExitRoot
) external payable
```

### Parameters

- **`token`**: Token contract address to transfer (0x0 for native gas token)
- **`amount`**: Amount of tokens to transfer
- **`destinationNetwork`**: Network ID of the destination chain
- **`callAddress`**: Contract address to call on destination chain
- **`fallbackAddress`**: Address to receive assets if execution fails
- **`callData`**: Encoded function call data
- **`forceUpdateGlobalExitRoot`**: Whether to update GER immediately

### Process Steps

1. **Token Preparation**: Handle different token types (native, WETH, ERC20)
2. **Asset Bridging**: Call `bridgeAsset` to transfer tokens
3. **Message Bridging**: Call `bridgeMessage` with encoded call data
4. **Event Emission**: Emit events for both operations

### Token Preparation Logic

#### Native Gas Token
```solidity
// Gas token already transferred to contract via msg.value
// No additional preparation needed
```

#### WETH
```solidity
// Transfer WETH from sender to contract
IWETH(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

#### ERC20 Tokens
```solidity
// Transfer ERC20 tokens from sender to contract
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

## Message Reception

The `onMessageReceived` function handles incoming Bridge-and-Call messages on the destination chain.

### Function Signature

```solidity
function onMessageReceived(
    address originAddress,
    uint32 originNetwork,
    bytes calldata data
) external payable
```

### Parameters

- **`originAddress`**: BridgeExtension address on source chain
- **`originNetwork`**: Network ID of source chain
- **`data`**: Encoded call data containing:
  - `dependsOnIndex`: Index of the asset bridge transaction
  - `callAddress`: Contract to call on destination
  - `fallbackAddress`: Fallback address for failed executions
  - `assetOriginalNetwork`: Original network of the asset
  - `assetOriginalAddress`: Original address of the asset
  - `callData`: Function call data

### Process Steps

1. **Access Control**: Verify caller is bridge contract and origin is valid
2. **Data Decoding**: Decode the message data
3. **Asset Verification**: Check if asset bridge transaction is claimed
4. **JumpPoint Creation**: Deploy JumpPoint contract with call parameters
5. **Asset Transfer**: Transfer assets to JumpPoint contract
6. **Function Execution**: Execute the call on target contract

## JumpPoint Contract

The JumpPoint contract is a temporary contract that handles the actual execution on the destination chain.

### Constructor

```solidity
constructor(
    address bridge,
    uint32 assetOriginalNetwork,
    address assetOriginalAddress,
    address callAddress,
    address fallbackAddress,
    bytes memory callData
) payable
```

### Execution Process

1. **Asset Detection**: Identify the type of transferred asset
2. **Asset Transfer**: Transfer asset to target contract
3. **Function Call**: Execute the specified function call
4. **Fallback Handling**: Handle failed executions by transferring to fallback address

### Asset Handling

#### ETH
```solidity
// Transfer ETH to callAddress
callAddress.call{value: address(this).balance}(callData);
```

#### WETH
```solidity
// Transfer WETH to callAddress
IWETH(wethAddress).transfer(callAddress, amount);
callAddress.call(callData);
```

#### ERC20 Tokens
```solidity
// Transfer ERC20 to callAddress
IERC20(tokenAddress).transfer(callAddress, amount);
callAddress.call(callData);
```

## Bridging Flows

### L2 to L2 Bridge-and-Call

1. **User Action**: User calls `bridgeAndCall` on L2A
2. **Asset Preparation**: Tokens prepared and locked on L2A
3. **Asset Bridging**: `bridgeAsset` called to transfer tokens
4. **Message Bridging**: `bridgeMessage` called with call data
5. **L2A Submission**: L2A submits transactions to L1
6. **GER Update**: Global Exit Root updated on L1
7. **L2B Sync**: L2B syncs with latest GER
8. **User Claim**: User claims both asset and message on L2B
9. **JumpPoint Execution**: JumpPoint contract executes call on L2B

### L1 to L2 Bridge-and-Call

1. **User Action**: User calls `bridgeAndCall` on L1
2. **Asset Preparation**: Tokens prepared and locked on L1
3. **Asset Bridging**: `bridgeAsset` called to transfer tokens
4. **Message Bridging**: `bridgeMessage` called with call data
5. **GER Update**: Global Exit Root updated on L1
6. **L2 Sync**: L2 syncs with latest GER
7. **User Claim**: User claims both asset and message on L2
8. **JumpPoint Execution**: JumpPoint contract executes call on L2

## Use Cases

### Cross-Chain DeFi

- **Liquidity Provision**: Provide liquidity and immediately stake in yield farms
- **Token Swaps**: Bridge tokens and execute swaps in single transaction
- **Lending**: Bridge collateral and immediately open lending positions

### Cross-Chain Gaming

- **Asset Transfers**: Transfer game assets and equip them immediately
- **State Updates**: Update game state across chains with asset transfers
- **Event Triggers**: Trigger game events based on cross-chain actions

### Cross-Chain Governance

- **Voting with Assets**: Transfer governance tokens and cast votes
- **Treasury Management**: Move treasury funds and execute proposals
- **Multi-Chain Proposals**: Execute proposals across multiple chains

### Cross-Chain Identity

- **Credential Verification**: Transfer identity tokens and verify credentials
- **Access Control**: Grant access to resources across chains
- **Identity Updates**: Update identity state across multiple chains

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Bridge Contract Only**: Only bridge contract can call `onMessageReceived`
- **Origin Validation**: Verify message origin is valid BridgeExtension
- **Asset Verification**: Ensure asset bridge transaction is properly claimed

### Execution Security

- **Gas Limits**: JumpPoint execution has gas limits to prevent infinite loops
- **Fallback Handling**: Failed executions transfer assets to fallback address
- **Contract Validation**: Target contracts should validate call sources

### Economic Security

- **Asset Locking**: Assets locked until successful execution or fallback
- **No Double Execution**: Each Bridge-and-Call can only be executed once
- **Proof Requirements**: Cryptographic proofs prevent invalid executions

## Best Practices

### Contract Design

- **Idempotent Functions**: Design target functions to be idempotent
- **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling in target contracts
- **Gas Estimation**: Accurately estimate gas requirements

### Security

- **Source Validation**: Validate call sources in target contracts
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access control for sensitive functions
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider rate limiting for high-value operations

### Monitoring

- **Event Logging**: Log important events in JumpPoint execution
- **Error Tracking**: Track and monitor execution failures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor gas usage and execution times
