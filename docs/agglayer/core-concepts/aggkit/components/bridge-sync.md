## Meet BridgeSync: The Event Collector

Think of BridgeSync as your **dedicated news reporter** whose beat is bridge transactions. While other components handle communication and state management, BridgeSync has one crucial job: **capturing every single bridge-related event** that happens across the networks and organizing it into a comprehensive, searchable database.

**BridgeSync** is the component responsible for **monitoring and indexing bridge events** from both L1 and L2 networks. It provides the data foundation that enables other AggKit components to track bridge transactions, generate certificates, and provide comprehensive bridge information through APIs.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Event Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of bridge contract events
- **Data Indexing**: Comprehensive indexing of bridge and claim transactions
- **State Management**: Maintains bridge transaction history and status
- **Reorg Handling**: Manages blockchain reorganizations gracefully
- **API Support**: Provides data foundation for Bridge Service APIs

## Why BridgeSync is Important

### Why Every Bridge Event Matters

Here's a real-world scenario that shows why BridgeSync is absolutely essential: Maria bridges 200 USDC from Ethereum to your chain at 2:15 PM. At 2:45 PM, she wants to check the status of her bridge transaction. At 3:30 PM, she wants to claim her USDC on your chain.

**Without BridgeSync**: Each of these requests would require expensive, slow queries to blockchain nodes, external APIs, or complex contract calls. The user experience would be terrible â€“ slow responses, incomplete information, frustrated users.

**With BridgeSync**: The moment Maria's bridge transaction happened, BridgeSync captured it, organized all the details, and made them instantly queryable. When she checks the status, the response is immediate. When she claims her USDC, all the necessary data is ready and waiting.

### **BridgeSync's Solution**

BridgeSync provides **comprehensive bridge data management**:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Sources"
        L1Bridge[L1 Bridge Contract]
        L2Bridge[L2 Bridge Contract]
        L1Events[BridgeEvent, ClaimEvent]
        L2Events[BridgeEvent, ClaimEvent]
    end
    
    subgraph "BridgeSync Processing"
        Monitor[Event Monitoring]
        Index[Data Indexing]

    end

## How BridgeSync Works

### **Event Processing Workflow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BC as Bridge Contract
    participant EVMDriver as EVM Driver
    participant Processor as BridgeSync Processor
    participant DB as Database
    participant API as Bridge Service
    
    Note over BC,API: Real-Time Event Processing
    BC->>EVMDriver: BridgeEvent / ClaimEvent
    EVMDriver->>Processor: Raw Event Data
    Processor->>Processor: Parse & Validate Event
    Processor->>DB: Store Bridge Transaction
    Processor->>API: Update Bridge Status
    
    Note over BC,API: Continuous Monitoring
    EVMDriver->>EVMDriver: Monitor New Blocks
    EVMDriver->>Processor: Process Block Events
    Processor->>DB: Update Transaction States
```

### **Bridge Event Types**

BridgeSync monitors several types of events:

#### **1. BridgeEvent**
Emitted when assets or messages are bridged **from** a network:

```solidity
event BridgeEvent(
    uint8 leafType,              // 0 = asset, 1 = message
    uint32 originNetwork,        // Source network ID
    address originAddress,       // Sender address
    uint32 destinationNetwork,   // Destination network ID
    address destinationAddress,  // Recipient address
    uint256 amount,              // Amount (for assets)
    bytes metadata,              // Additional data
    uint32 depositCount          // Index in Local Exit Tree
);
```

#### **2. ClaimEvent**
Emitted when assets or messages are claimed **on** a network:

```solidity
event ClaimEvent(
    uint256 globalIndex,         // Global transaction index
    uint32 originNetwork,        // Source network ID
    address originAddress,       // Original sender
    address destinationAddress,  // Claim recipient
    uint256 amount               // Claimed amount
);
```

### **Data Processing Pipeline**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Data Collection"
        Events[Raw Events] --> Parser[Event Parser]
        Parser --> Validator[Data Validator]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Storage"
        Validator --> Bridge[Bridge Table]
        Validator --> Claims[Claims Table]
        Validator --> Tokens[Token Mappings]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Access"
        Bridge --> Query[Query Interface]
        Claims --> Query
        Tokens --> Query
        Query --> API[Bridge Service API]
    end
    
    style Parser fill:#e8f5e8
    style Validator fill:#e3f2fd
    style Query fill:#fff3e0
```

## Integration with Other Components

### **AggSender Integration**

BridgeSync provides **essential data** for certificate generation:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BS as BridgeSync
    participant AS as AggSender
    participant AL as Agglayer
    
    Note over BS,AL: Certificate Data Flow
    BS->>AS: Get Bridge Events (fromBlock, toBlock)
    AS->>BS: Bridge Exits Data
    BS->>AS: Get Imported Bridge Exits
    AS->>BS: Imported Claims Data
    AS->>AL: Submit Certificate with Bridge Data
```

**Data Provided**:

- Bridge exits (outbound transactions from your L2)
- Imported bridge exits (inbound claims to your L2)
- Transaction proofs and metadata
- Block range information for certificate scope

### **Bridge Service Integration**

BridgeSync is the **primary data source** for Bridge Service APIs:

```mermaid
graph LR
    BS[BridgeSync Database] --> API[Bridge Service API]
    API --> Endpoints{API Endpoints}
    
    Endpoints --> Bridges[bridges]
    Endpoints --> Claims[claims]
    Endpoints --> Mappings[token-mappings]
    Endpoints --> Proofs[claim-proof]
    
    style BS fill:#e3f2fd
    style API fill:#fff3e0
```

All Bridge Service endpoints query BridgeSync databases for transaction data.
