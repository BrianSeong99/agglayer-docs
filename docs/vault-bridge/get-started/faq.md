## **General**

**How does Vault Bridge make money? Are fees charged?**  
No. The Vault Bridge protocol does not charge users a protocol fee. In most cases, the licensor of technology used with the protocol assesses a license fee of 5% of realized yield onlyâ€”never on principal. Collection and distributions of such fee is handled by a third-party escrow agent, as a set-off against accrued yield. In some integrations, a portion of such license fee may be shared with infrastructure partners under separate agreements.

**How do I get started?**  
Before using Vault Bridge, certain legal documentation is necessary, including entry into an agreement with the escrow agent. [Contact our team to get started on the documentation process.](https://info.polygon.technology/vaultbridge-intake-form) 

**How is risk managed?**  
Strategies are curated by independent teams (e.g., Gauntlet, Steakhouse Financial). External assessments (e.g., Credora) and audits provide additional assurances. See [Risk & Security](../reference/risk-security.md) for more information.

## **For Accounts (Chains, Rollups, Fintechs)**

**Where is yield sent?**  
Yield is distributed periodically to the Ethereum wallet address provided during onboarding. All distributions are administered by an independent third-party escrow and paid in newly minted vbTokens.

**Which assets are supported?**

* vbUSDC  
* vbUSDT  
* vbUSDS  
* vbETH  
* vbWBTC  
* vbSOL (Planned)

**Do chains have to use vbTokens as canonical tokens?**  
Not strictly. However, making vbTokens canonical simplifies UX and liquidity. If the chain starts with other representations (like bridged USDC), you can migrate later via the Native Converter.

## **For Agents (RaaS/Bridge Providers)**

**Do I get a share of yield fees?**  
Agents receive a share of the base yield fee and may also negotiate additional splits with accounts. Exact terms depend on agreements.
